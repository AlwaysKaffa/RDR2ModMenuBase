# RDR2-Invoker-Entrypoint-Dumper

Native Function invoker that works for RDR2:Online

To use the dumper you need to load it with ScriptHook and dump them in singleplayer, since using ScriptHook online will get you banned.

Make sure to add junkcode to the source original functions as this source now seems to be detected
